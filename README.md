#RevealTalks

All talks and slides written with Reveal.js will live in here. To make setting
CSS paths easier there will only be one folder deep and the table of contents
found here will help to navigate them.

The [template](template.html) file is a base template to be used for writing
new talks. It needs a lot of work.
